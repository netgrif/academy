# Petriflow 102 — Tutorials Overview

Welcome to **Petriflow 102** — a continuation of your journey into **Petri Nets**, **workflow semantics**, and the deeper logic behind **Petriflow-based low-code processes**.

---

## 💡 What You’ll Learn

### 🎓 **Theory Meets Practice**
In this module, you’ll go beyond forms and user interfaces and dive into **how workflows actually work** under the hood — powered by **Petri Net theory**.

You’ll explore:
1. **Petri Nets & Token Semantics** — the foundation of PetriFlow
2. **Interpretation of Places** — understanding model meaning
3. **Sequence Variations & Token Multiplicity**
4. **Types of Arcs** — Read, Inhibitor, and Reset Arcs
