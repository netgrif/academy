# Petriflow 101 — Tutorials Overview

Welcome to **Petriflow 101** — your first guided journey into building low-code, object-centric workflows using **Petriflow** and **eTask**.

---

## 💡 What You’ll Build

### 🧩 **Showcase of a Request Application**
Built in the low-code language **Petriflow**, based on **Petri Nets** and **Object-Centric Processes** with dynamic **Forms**.

A simple web form where anyone can submit:
**Name**, **Surname**, **Email (required)**, **Phone**, **Request text (required)**, and an **Attachment**.

The request is then **processed step-by-step** through:
1. **Registration Desk** – employee reviews and routes the request
2. **Legal Department** – lawyer adds a **statement (required)**
3. **PR Department** – employee writes a **polite reply**

Throughout the process, the **user can track the status** and **see the final answer**.
