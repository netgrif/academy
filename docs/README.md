### A brief introduction to the Netgrif Platform

#### New video resources (since Q2 2025)

We have published multiple new videos on our [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@netgrif) in **three categories**:

- **[Netgrif Platform & Company Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UltWpsmjXkg&list=PLHRoRm51BST-DpfxLlb7CJcI3myHlcn9e&pp=gAQB0gcJCWUEOCosWNin)**  
  High-level introductions and presentations about our platform and company vision.

- **[Netgrif Petriflow Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAVgSaBOkUE&list=PLHRoRm51BST_iI-NlBu_xJgR8l8qMrwN_&pp=gAQB)**  
  Focused on our proprietary **Petriflow language**, these videos explain how the **builder, language, and interpreter** work together. They are an excellent starting point to understand the foundations of modeling with Netgrif.

- **[Netgrif Platform Basics Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FLiukKa5Vs&list=PLHRoRm51BST_ARUavNGQcu-5mP2enSHj9&pp=gAQB)**  
  Tutorials that show how the platform can be installed **locally or on servers**, and explain how the **interpreter and end-user environment** function and look. This playlist is the recommended entry point for new users who want to quickly get familiar with the platform.

We recommend that everyone who is starting with the Netgrif Platform first checks out the **Petriflow** and **Platform Basics** courses as they provide the best introduction to working with Netgrif.
